# A-simple-scroll-animetion
Here we simply created scrolling animation by putting event listener on scroll
We simply select the div we want to be animate and get position of that div by getBoundingVlientRect and then we simply get window innerheight and put f/else statement to add and remove class and inside that class we put animations
